# Explore GitHub

1. Go to [github.com/explore]()
2. Click on the section labeled .fourteen[Popular Topics]
3. Scroll through the list to find .fourteen[Python]
4. These repos are _related_ to Python, but we only want to see repos _written_ in Python, so select it from the .fourteen[Language] dropdown
5. Then .fourteen[Sort] by .fourteen[Most stars]

# Explore GitHub

Look through at least .fourteen[ten] project repos and make a list of common file or directory names. Don't go too deep into directories, just skim through the top level or two.

Once you have your list, do a quick Google search and see if you can find out what the file or directory is for.

Then, pick a different language to explore. See if projects in that language use items from your list, or if they have their own common names.
