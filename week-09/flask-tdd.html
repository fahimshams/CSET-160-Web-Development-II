# TDD Basics

1. Write a test
2. Run tests: it should .eleven[fail]
3. Write the code
4. Run tests: it should .fourteen[pass]
5. Refactor and repeat

# TDD Basics

This description is oversimplified and doesn't really help.

---

# Test Practice

Install .eight[pytest] globally, not in a virtual environment:

```bash
$ pip3 install pytest
```

Now make a new directory called .fourteen[test-practice] and move into it.

---

# Test Practice

Follow along with the demo:

- test_hello()
  - returns "Hello World"
  - returns "Hello " and a name
- test_add()
  - returns sum of two numbers
  - returns sum of three numbers
  - raises error when adding string
  - doesn't raise error if string could be number

---

# Test Practice

1. Find a partner.
2. You write a simple test that will definitely break.
3. Your partner writes _just enough_ code to make it pass.
4. Then switch places. Keep going until you have a good function.
