# Agenda

1. [ ] Making Functions
2. [ ] Calling Functions
3. [ ] More About Files
4. [ ] Returning Values

#  Hurray, Functions!

- Python functions:
  - named pieces of code just like variables name values
  - take arguments, just like argv
  - are mini-scripts within scripts!

---

# [Exercise 16](https://github.com/ts-cset/cset-160/blob/master/python/ex16.py)

- use the keyword .eight[def] to define a function
- .eight[*args] (asterisk args) is like .eight[argv] for functions
- end the function definition with a colon, .eight[:]
- .eleven[the function body MUST be indented!]

---

# Function Checklist:

- Does it start with .eight[def]?
- Is the name only characters and underscores?
- Did you put an open paren right after the name?
- Are you arguments, if any, separated by a comma and space?

---

# Function Checklist: (cont.)

- Are all of your arguments unique?
- Did you close the parenthesis and end with a colon?
- Did you indent the body of your function?
- Did you "end" your function by returning to the original indent level?

---

# Function Checklist: (cont.)

* Did you call your function by typing its name?
* Did you put an open paren after the name?
* Did you put the right values inside the parens, separated by commas?
* Did you close the parentheses?

# [Exercise 17](https://github.com/ts-cset/cset-160/blob/master/python/ex17.py)

You might be noticing that .eight[scope] for variables is similar to 
JavaScript. Try to see if there are any differences.

---

# Exercise 17

- If you don't understand what's happening, try writing a simple comment above every line.
- Write a few more functions on your own for practice.
- Then try calling each of them a couple different times.

---


# [Exercise 18](https://github.com/ts-cset/cset-160/blob/master/python/ex18.py)

- Trace how .eight[current_line] is changing throughout the file and how it becomes .eight[line_count].
- If you don't remember `seek`, use `pydoc` to understand what it's doing in the script:
```sh
$ pydoc file.seek
```
- Rewrite the script using the shorthand addition .eight[+=]. It should look familiar.

---

# [Exercise 19](https://github.com/ts-cset/cset-160/blob/master/python/ex19.py)

- What is the difference between .eight[print] and .eight[return]?
- Write a few more functions using .eight[return] to understand it.
- Returned values can be used in other functions. Write another chain of functions like the one at the end of the file.

---

# More Practice

Try using .eight[int(input())] and .eight[float(input())] to make a script with functions that use math with values entered by the user.

---

The End!
